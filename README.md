# Dataview Properties

Dataview Properties allows you to automatically copy Dataview inline fields (and their values, even calculated ones!) into frontmatter properties and keep them synchronized.

## ‚ú® Features
The plugin offers the following features:

- Conversion of Dataview queries (DQL and DataviewJS) to frontmatter
- Support for both block and inline queries
- Automatic synchronization based on a configurable interval
- Dedicated command to manually trigger synchronization
- Evaluation of calculated values before insertion into frontmatter

> [!WARNING]
> The Dataview plugin must be installed and activated in your Obsidian vault.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

- **Interval**: The time interval (in milliseconds) at which the plugin will check for changes in the Dataview queries and update the frontmatter properties accordingly. The default value is 1000ms (1 second).
- **Ignored fields** : A list (of string) of fields to ignore (aka that won't be copied). Separate the fields with a comma or a new line. To use regex, encapsulate with `/` (ex: `/^name$/i`). 
    - **Insensitive** : If checked, the plugin will ignore the case of the field names when checking for matches. For example, if you have a field named "Name" and you set "name" in the ignored fields, it will be ignored (and vice versa).
    - **Ignore accent** : If checked, the plugin will ignore accents when checking for matches. For example, if you have a field named "√©cole" and you set "ecole" in the ignored fields, it will be ignored, and vice versa.
- **Dataview** : Enable/disable the evaluation of each type of dataview query. Only inline queries are supported.
    - **Dataview Query Language (DQL)**
    - **DataviewJS**

> [!CAUTION]
> Only string/numbers/date are supported in the frontmatter. When the evaluated queries returns a html, it will converted to markdown. 

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage
### Automatic synchronization
By default, the plugin automatically synchronizes the Dataview queries within the frontmatter (proprieties) at the interval defined in the settings.

### Manual command

You can also trigger the synchronization manually by using the command palette (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd> | <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd>) and searching for "Dataview Properties : Add the Dataview field to the frontmatter". This will force the plugin to check for changes in the Dataview queries and update the frontmatter properties accordingly.

> [!TIP]
> For a file containing:
> ```markdown
> ---
> name: "name"
> force: 12
> agility: 5
> ---
>
> # Hello world
> Vitality:: `$= this.force + this.agility`
> ```
> The plugin will update the file accordingly:
> ```markdown
> ---
> name: "name"
> force: 12
> agility: 5
> Vitality: 17
> ---
>
> # Hello world
> Vitality:: `$= this.force + this.agility`
> ```

The plugin also works with more complex queries, like links (and they will be converted to markdown links as `[[mylinks]]`), date or numbers.

> [!CAUTION]
> - Widget and function won't be added to the frontmatter.
> - HTML will be converted to markdown.
